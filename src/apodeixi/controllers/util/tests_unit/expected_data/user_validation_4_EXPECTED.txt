==================    This test verifies that the following user validation works:

User let blank the entity name in a row with data for that entity, and the software can't correct it

================     Below is the error message the user would get:

******** Functional Trace ********

Problem:	Did you forget to set 'Institution' in excel row 7 of worksheet 'Properties'?
It is the entity for the interval ['Institution', 'State', 'Zipcode'],
 so you can't leave it blank unless you also  clear data you wrote  in row 7 for these 2 columns:
['State', 'Zipcode']

=> Alternatively, consider changing the range in the Posting Label to exclude such rows.

Here are the functional activities that led to the problem:

---->	activity	Running Mock_Controller


---->	activity	Parsing data for 1 manifest

            kind                : properties
            excel_range         : B2:I100
